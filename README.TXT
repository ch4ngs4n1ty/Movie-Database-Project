Using LaTex on Overleaf
—-------------—--------
If you are new to LaTeX, the easiest way to get started might be to set up your own free account at overleaf.com, and create a new project by uploading the zip file. Once the project is created, you can share it with the rest of your team. You and your team will then need to edit the file, report.tex. This file will contain the text of your report. Once this file is edited to your satisfaction, you can submit the generated pdf file.

However, if you do use Overleaf, it’s your responsibility to ensure that your account is kept secure and your files are kept private so that nobody except your team mates can access the account. Making your project public will be considered an act of academic dishonesty.

Notes: 
  For your convenience, the initial generated pdf has been copied to a separate file REPORT_INITIAL.PDF so that you can refer to it for formatting help and suggestions. Don't submit this file by mistake.
